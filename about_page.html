                        <p>
                            I'm Areen – a UX designer with a passion for creating digital experiences that are more than just a click(or a tap)!
                        </p>
                            <p>
                                My journey into the design world wasn't your typical path. With a research background, I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking and creative flair to every project.
                            </p>
                                <p>The spark for UX ignited when I stumbled upon a women's safety app during my time in the development sector. It was a lightbulb moment that showed me the incredible impact design can have on people's lives. Since then, I've been on a mission to craft designs that not only look good but make a real difference. </p>

                            <p>I'm a firm believer that design is at its best when it's human-centric. My work sits at the crossroads of understanding people, leveraging technology, and making a positive impact. Every project is a chance to tell a story, to create something meaningful that resonates with users.</p>

                            <p> Beyond the pixels and wireframes, you'll find me in the kitchen, playing with ingredients and perfecting the art of baking. Because just like in design, it's the little details that make all the difference! </p>

                            <p> So, welcome to my corner of the web & happy exploring!  </p>

                <h1> I also like to write...</h1> 
                    <p1> My journey with writing started back when I worked as a researcher. The real joy for me was breaking down my research into simpler terms.  I aim to continue this tradition by penning down my design musings and explaining my design decisions through my medium blogs! </p1>
