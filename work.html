            <h2>The Inspiration</h2>
                <p>Being a regular user of the UPI gateway, the ease of making payments anytime and anywhere brought along the challenge of struggling to recall specific transactions. Moreover, the quick and effortless payment process also led to the inconvenience of unintentional overspending, as it was so convenient to make payments instantly.</p>

                <p>There were certain steps to the ordering process that can be added to complete the entire user flow of ordering food through the allergy profile feature:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Investment User Flow: At present, I've integrated just a primary screen dedicated to investments. However, expanding the user flow to include investment options and offering tailored suggestions based on overall savings and goal allocations would significantly enhance Penny's usability as a comprehensive personal finance platform.</p></li>
                    <li> <p>Payment only after budget allocation: During one of the usability testing interviews, a valuable suggestion emerged: to offer users the choice to proceed with payments only if they've selected a budget category. This option could be presented during the user onboarding process, allowing individuals to decide the level of strictness they prefer in managing their budget effectively. </p></li>
                    <li> <p>Game-like savings difficulty levels: Expanding on this, another feature could involve allowing users to customize the "difficulty" level of adhering to their set budget. This functionality would empower users to tailor their budgeting experience according to their preferences and financial goals. Users could select a higher difficulty level for stricter adherence to their budget, prompting more frequent alerts or restrictions on spending. Conversely, opting for a lower difficulty level could provide more flexibility in budget management, allowing for occasional deviations without constant reminders. This customizable feature would cater to varying user needs and enhance the personalization of the budgeting experience within the app. </p></li>
